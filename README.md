# Playervotes2016
The playervotes redux plugin with updates that are more centered around the old plugin's functionality without any of the leaks.

It is highly, HIGHLY recommended that you remove basevotes for this plugin for chat triggers to work!!!! If you use this plugin, you should not be using basevotes!

2.1 Update (06-11-2018)
------------------------------------
- Compiled/Updated code for SM 1.8
- Minor updates to code for compatibility (no major changes still has all functions).

2.0 Initial Commit (09-01-2016)
------------------------------------
- Based on playervotes redux version by intox: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=217619
- Plugin features all the original items (kick, ban, and mute).
- Additional features added (gag and silence).
- Removes votemap feature (map chooser plugins should take care of this).
- Accompanied is an optional plugin named adminvotes. This plugin will allow you to do the text/chat votes that the basevotes plugin allowed. This was created separately just in case admins wanted this.
